When using this license, it indicates that the project adheres to the 
VaneTeamRule policy. However, in the event that the project generates 
income or similar revenue, negotiations with project stakeholders are 
possible.

Stakeholders for Negotiation:
If there are multiple project stakeholders, the majority agreement or 
negotiations with the project manager will take precedence.

Exceptional Circumstances:
If it is difficult to contact stakeholders, temporary approval may be 
obtained from the overall project manager. However, if permission cannot 
be obtained from project stakeholders later on, temporary approval may 
be revoked.
